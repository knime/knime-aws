      provider-name="KNIME AG, Zurich, Switzerland">

   <description>
      This feature is no longer required since a newer version of the driver is now included in the KNIME Amazon Redshift Connector And Tools extension. Install this feature only to be able to execute existing workflows that used the older driver without altering them. To use the new driver in existing workflows please open the node dialog of the Amazon Redshift Connector node and select the new driver. 
This older version of the driver is distributed under a non-open source proprietary license.
